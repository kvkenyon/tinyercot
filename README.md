# tinyercot

A small, fully typed client for ERCOT public data.

**Development status:** all 242 Public Reports endpoints have typed methods and captured-response tests. The separate ESR API is awaiting an enabled subscription key. MIS is not included.

```python
from datetime import date
from tinyercot import Client

with Client() as ercot:
    prices = ercot.np4_190_cd.dam_stlmnt_pnt_prices_iter(
        deliveryDateFrom=date(2026, 1, 1),
        deliveryDateTo=date(2026, 1, 2),
        settlementPoint="HB_HOUSTON",
    )
    for price in prices:
        print(price.deliveryDate, price.settlementPointPrice)
```

Pass `username`, `password`, and `subscription_key` to `Client`, or set
`ERCOT_USERNAME`, `ERCOT_PASSWORD`, and `ERCOT_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`.
Authentication is lazy; the client refreshes tokens and retries transient failures.

Each product exposes generated methods with named, typed filters and Pydantic row
models. A method returns one `Page[Row]`; its `_iter` variant streams all pages.
`_async` and `_iter_async` provide asynchronous access. Date and decimal values
retain their Python types. Nullable source cells are represented by `None`.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from tinyercot import Client

with Client() as ercot:
    products = ercot.products()
    history = ercot.archives("np4-190-cd")
    document = history.archives[0]
    Path("prices.zip").write_bytes(
        ercot.download("np4-190-cd", [document.docId])
    )

    bundles = ercot.bundles("np4-190-cd")
    Path("monthly.zip").write_bytes(
        ercot.download("np4-190-cd", [bundles.bundles[0].docId], kind="bundle")
    )
```

Archive and bundle listings expose typed metadata. Downloads return the original
ZIP bytes. Typed historical readers currently cover: DAM
settlement prices, real-time settlement prices, DAM ancillary-service clearing
prices, DAM bus LMPs and shadow prices, actual load by weather zone, forecast zone,
and study area, and all 17 tables in the 60-day DAM disclosure ZIP. The eight
single-table reports have oldest-listed and recent samples; 13 disclosure tables
have 2014 and recent samples, and four newer tables have recent samples only. Their
files have been downloaded and decoded; other archive schemas are still being
mapped.

```python
from datetime import datetime

with Client() as ercot:
    history = ercot.np4_190_cd.dam_stlmnt_pnt_prices_history
    for price in history.rows(
        posted_from=datetime(2014, 5, 1),
        posted_to=datetime(2014, 5, 1, 23, 59, 59),
        where=lambda price: price.settlementPoint == "HB_HOUSTON",
    ):
        print(price.deliveryDate, price.settlementPointPrice)
```

Publication timestamps are ERCOT local timestamps, and both bounds are inclusive.
They select files by **publication date**, which can differ from the dates inside
them. The predicate filters typed rows after download. With no publication bounds,
`rows()` reads all listed archive documents. Publication bounds are sent to ERCOT to limit listing pages at the source.
Matching documents are downloaded individually; large backfills can take considerable time.
Corrections are preserved as published; rows are not deduplicated.

`history.read(zip_bytes)` reads an existing download, including nested ZIPs.
`history.download([doc_id])` downloads and decodes selected documents; pass
`kind="bundle"` for monthly bundle IDs. Bundle errors propagate; automatic bundle
fallback is not implemented yet. Unsupported CSV layouts raise with the member
name instead of silently dropping data. These readers add no runtime dependencies.

Listing metadata includes the server's total and page counts; `iter_documents()` streams all listing pages.

## Development

Runtime dependencies are `httpx`, `httpx-retries`, and `pydantic`. The handwritten
core handles authentication, transport, pagination, and metadata. Product methods
and row models are generated from saved ERCOT operation and field definitions.

```sh
uv sync --group dev
uv run python tools/generate_client.py
uv run mypy tinyercot tests/typing_client.py --strict --follow-untyped-imports
uv run pytest
uv build
```

Generation fails if an endpoint has no field schema. During discovery only,
`--allow-incomplete` emits available endpoints and reports the missing count.
Public dashboards are available through `ercot.dashboards`: fuel mix, grid
conditions, energy storage, generation outages, DC-tie flows, system prices,
supply/demand, combined wind/solar, system demand, ancillary services, weather,
and the current locational price map.

Source-specific corrections live in `tools/inputs/type-overrides.json`,
`row-fields.json`, and `query-defaults.json`. ERCOT declares hour-ending labels
and offer identifiers as numeric on two reports. The ESR-west report includes
two metadata-only columns absent from its rows and has an invalid default sort;
its generated method uses `SCEDTimestamp` by default. Captured responses support
these small corrections. Large forecasts may need a date filter or a longer
client timeout. Specify `sort` when supplying `dir`. Tests use saved public responses and mocked
HTTP; credentials are not part of the test suite.

Disclosure readers select their own CSV member from the shared ZIP. For example,
`ercot.np3_966_er._60_dam_load_res_data_history` returns generated historical rows
that preserve the old `RRSAwarded` field separately from newer `RRSPFRAwarded`,
`RRSFFRAwarded`, and `RRSUFRAwarded` fields. Fields absent in a captured schema
are `None`. The current API row contracts remain unchanged. Reading a ZIP that
predates a table raises a missing-member error; full-range queries across table
introduction dates still need handling.
