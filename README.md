# tinyercot

A small, fully typed client for ERCOT public data.

**Development status:** all 242 Public Reports endpoints have typed methods and captured-response tests. The separate ESR API is awaiting an enabled subscription key. MIS is not included.

```python
from datetime import date
from tinyercot import Client

with Client() as ercot:
    prices = ercot.np4_190_cd.dam_stlmnt_pnt_prices_iter(
        deliveryDateFrom=date(2026, 1, 1),
        deliveryDateTo=date(2026, 1, 2),
        settlementPoint="HB_HOUSTON",
    )
    for price in prices:
        print(price.deliveryDate, price.settlementPointPrice)
```

Pass `username`, `password`, and `subscription_key` to `Client`, or set
`ERCOT_USERNAME`, `ERCOT_PASSWORD`, and `ERCOT_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`.
Authentication is lazy; the client refreshes tokens and retries transient failures.

Each product exposes generated methods with named, typed filters and Pydantic row
models. A method returns one `Page[Row]`; its `_iter` variant streams all pages.
`_async` and `_iter_async` provide asynchronous access. Date and decimal values
retain their Python types. Nullable source cells are represented by `None`.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from tinyercot import Client

with Client() as ercot:
    products = ercot.products()
    history = ercot.archives("np4-190-cd")
    document = history.archives[0]
    Path("prices.zip").write_bytes(ercot.download("np4-190-cd", [document.docId]))

    bundles = ercot.bundles("np4-190-cd")
    Path("monthly.zip").write_bytes(
        ercot.download("np4-190-cd", [bundles.bundles[0].docId], kind="bundle")
    )
```

Archive and bundle listings expose typed metadata. Downloads return the original
ZIP bytes. Typed historical readers currently cover: DAM
settlement prices, real-time settlement prices, DAM ancillary-service clearing
prices, DAM bus LMPs and shadow prices, actual load by weather zone, forecast zone,
and study area, and all 17 tables in the 60-day DAM disclosure ZIP. The eight
single-table reports have oldest-listed and recent samples; 13 disclosure tables
have 2014 and recent samples, and four newer tables have recent samples only. Their
files have been downloaded and decoded; other archive schemas are still being
mapped.

```python
from datetime import datetime

with Client() as ercot:
    history = ercot.np4_190_cd.dam_stlmnt_pnt_prices_history
    for price in history.rows(
        posted_from=datetime(2014, 5, 1),
        posted_to=datetime(2014, 5, 1, 23, 59, 59),
        where=lambda price: price.settlementPoint == "HB_HOUSTON",
    ):
        print(price.deliveryDate, price.settlementPointPrice)
```

Publication timestamps are ERCOT local timestamps, and both bounds are inclusive.
They select files by **publication date**, which can differ from the dates inside
them. The predicate filters typed rows after download. With no publication bounds,
`rows()` reads all listed archive documents. Publication bounds are sent to ERCOT to limit listing pages at the source.
Matching documents are downloaded individually by default. Pass `batch_size=25`
to `rows()` or `download()` to group requests. Batches are capped by the product
metadata and the API ceiling of 1,000 files; larger batches use more memory.
Monthly bundles are still retrieved individually. Large backfills can take considerable time.
Corrections are preserved as published; rows are not deduplicated.

`history.read(zip_bytes)` reads an existing download, including nested ZIPs.
`history.download([doc_id])` downloads and decodes selected documents; pass
`kind="bundle"` for monthly bundle IDs. Bundle errors propagate; automatic bundle
fallback is not implemented yet. Unsupported CSV layouts raise with the member
name instead of silently dropping data. These readers add no runtime dependencies.

Listing metadata includes the server's total and page counts; `iter_documents()` streams all listing pages.

## Development

Runtime dependencies are `httpx`, `httpx-retries`, and `pydantic`. The handwritten
core handles authentication, transport, pagination, and metadata. Product methods
and row models are generated from saved ERCOT operation and field definitions.

```sh
uv sync --group dev
uv run python tools/generate_client.py
uv run mypy tinyercot tests/typing_client.py --strict --follow-untyped-imports
uv run pytest
uv build
```

Generation fails if an endpoint has no field schema. During discovery only,
`--allow-incomplete` emits available endpoints and reports the missing count.
Public dashboards are available through `ercot.dashboards`: fuel mix, grid
conditions, energy storage, generation outages, DC-tie flows, system prices,
supply/demand, combined wind/solar, system demand, ancillary services, weather,
and the current locational price map.

Source-specific corrections live in `tools/inputs/type-overrides.json`,
`row-fields.json`, and `query-defaults.json`. ERCOT declares hour-ending labels
and offer identifiers as numeric on two reports. The ESR-west report includes
two metadata-only columns absent from its rows and has an invalid default sort;
its generated method uses `SCEDTimestamp` by default. Captured responses support
these small corrections. Large forecasts may need a date filter or a longer
client timeout. Specify `sort` when supplying `dir`. Tests use saved public responses and mocked
HTTP; credentials are not part of the test suite.

Disclosure readers select their own CSV member from the shared ZIP. For example,
`ercot.np3_966_er._60_dam_load_res_data_history` returns generated historical rows
that preserve the old `RRSAwarded` field separately from newer `RRSPFRAwarded`,
`RRSFFRAwarded`, and `RRSUFRAwarded` fields. Fields absent in a captured schema
are `None`. The current API row contracts remain unchanged. Reading a ZIP that
predates a table raises a missing-member error; full-range queries across table
introduction dates still need handling.

Archive-only CSV products also have generated namespaces: resource ownership
(`ercot.np3_988_er.resources_history`), public load estimation counts
(`ercot.copg_316.load_estimation_counts_history`), and confidentiality-expired
adjusted meter load (`ercot.np1_300.adjusted_meter_load_history`). These expose the same typed
`read`, `download`, and `rows` methods without inventing row-query API endpoints.
DUNS identifiers remain strings, counts are integers, and percentages are decimals.

`ercot.eia_930_er.daily_operations_history` reads both captured EIA daily layouts.
Its `HR1` through `HR25` cells are `Decimal | datetime | None`: demand, generation,
and flow values stay numeric, while UTC rows carry timezone-aware timestamps.
A published `24:00:00Z` becomes midnight on the following date. The older
`postedDate` and `interconnectedBalancingAuthorityCode` fields are preserved
separately from the newer `dataDate` and `dataCode` fields. This reader preserves
wide source rows; it does not join timing rows to measurement rows.

Additional historical readers cover DAM energy bought/sold, PTP obligation
results, system lambda, real-time bus and settlement-point LMPs, ancillary-service
plans, and wind actuals/forecasts. Legacy bus `LMP` is separate from newer capped
and uncapped prices. The wind history model preserves the old combined west/north
region and full `hourEndingTimestamp` separately from newer region fields and
integer `hourEnding`. API posting timestamps absent from a CSV remain `None`.

Known optional columns can appear in intermediate combinations. Required model
fields still apply, and unknown columns, duplicate aliases, or ambiguous reused
headers raise an error. This supports compatible schema evolution without
silently discarding source columns or assuming changed fields mean the same thing.

Install `tinyercot[files]` for typed XLSX archives. This adds workbook support
without changing the dependencies needed for API and CSV access:

```python
with Client() as ercot:
    for row in ercot.np1_346_er.outages_history.rows(
        posted_from=datetime(2026, 8, 1),
        posted_to=datetime(2026, 8, 2),
    ):
        print(row.resourceName, row.actualOutageStart, row.plannedEndDate)
```

Workbook readers also cover monthly load-resource demand response
(`ercot.np3_108.demand_response_history`) and ancillary-service deployment factors
(`ercot.np5_520_er.deployment_factors_history`). `sourceSheet` preserves the source
worksheet, including separate CLR and NCLR demand response tables; older reports
have a single `Report Data` sheet. Month fields are dates on the first of the month.
Older outage reports expose `returnToServiceDate`; newer reports expose separate
`plannedEndDate` and `actualEndDate` fields. Missing fields remain `None`.
These readers have been checked against the oldest available and recent sampled
workbooks, not every intervening publication.


Historical readers also cover five-minute wind and solar generation, hourly solar
forecasts, geographical wind/solar generation and forecasts, and system-wide
demand. Use the API method name with `_history`, for example
`ercot.np4_742_cd.wpp_hrly_actual_fcast_geo_history.rows(...)`.
The older five-minute wind layout preserves its combined region as `LZWestNorth`;
individual west/north values remain `None`. Older solar forecasts preserve a full
`hourEndingTimestamp` instead of inventing a delivery date and integer hour.
Archived five-minute timestamps retain their seconds where supplied.

In the September 2026 archive probes, oldest downloadable samples reached April
2014 for five-minute wind and February 2016 for solar. Regional reports started
later, and the system-wide demand listing reached only March 2026. These are
observed archive bounds, not guarantees of complete intervening data or permanent
retention; inspect each product's listings when selecting a backfill.
